# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create and set up your Vite React project.

### 1. Create a New Vite Project

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Vite project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. You can choose the default settings or customize them according to your needs.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

To start the development server and see your project in action, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to the provided local address (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) to view your project.

## Collaborating on the Project

If you're collaborating on this project, follow these additional steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditi020/RapidBite.git
```

Replace the URL with the actual URL of the repository.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd repository-name
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

After cloning the project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

To work on a new feature or fix a bug, create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Make Changes and Commit

Make your changes, and when you're ready to commit, follow these steps:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
```

### 6. Push Your Branch

Push your branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Go to the repository on GitHub (or other hosting service) and create a pull request from your branch to the main branch. Be sure to describe the changes you've made.

### 8. Review and Merge

Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch.
